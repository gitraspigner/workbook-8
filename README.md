### 📝 Description
Contains a collection of my starter-level Java (DataManager class, DAO class), SQL/mySQL, & Maven exercise solutions from week 9 (workbook 8). <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the exercises from the week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. However, I was able to upload the databases (Northwind Traders & Sakila (Movies)) referenced. <br>

#### 🔖 Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
