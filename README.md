### 📝 Description
Contains a collection of my starter-level Java (DataManager class, DAO class), SQL/mySQL, & Maven exercise solutions from week 9 (workbook 8). <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the exercises from the week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. However, I was able to upload the databases (Northwind Traders & Sakila (Movies)) referenced. <br>

#### *Topics covered include:*<br> 
- Maven
  - pom.xml
- JDBC
  - How to Add Its Dependency in Maven
  - Prepared Statement vs. Statement (Benefits of Using Prepared Statement)
  - Result Set
  - Using Try-With-Resources (for a Connection, Prepared Statement, or Result Set)
  - Data Managers & Data Access Objects (DAO)
- CRUD Operations (with heavy emphasis on C, R, & D)
- Git Via Command Line (for me: Windows CMD)
  - Basics: File/Directory Navigation & Creation, Clone, Stage/Commit/Push/Pull Changes, Branch

### 💭 My Thoughts
- I think that this week was a good review for me regarding syntaxes, specifically: Maven, using Prepared Statement, and the JDBC methods to call doing different CRUD operations. Additionally, it was also helpful to continue building SQL queries to further familiarize myself with their syntaxes as well. This thoughts section is not as long as other workbooks or workshops despite the fact that Maven, JDBC, and SQL are newer concepts in the course curriculum (than Java). I feel confident with these so far, even given all that we've covered.
- A note about the Sakila Database ([Here](https://github.com/gitraspigner/workbook-8/blob/master/src/main/java/com/pluralsight/databaseFiles/sakila-db.sql)): It only includes movies from the year 2006, so don't be alarmed when searching the dataset (this is the way it was designed, I am open to modifying it at some point (with or without the help of ChatGPT, it doesn't matter to me either way, only so that there's more diverse data)).

I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
